"""Put a slot's stored K-profile back when the printer has lost the selection.

A tray's ``cali_idx`` can fall back to -1 without anything else in the AMS
report changing: an X1 Carbon power-cycled mid-print came back with every slot
on the default K while spools, tags and remain% were exactly as before (#3219).
``on_ams_change`` is keyed on tray_type / tag_uid / remain, so it never saw
that, and two queued jobs went out on the default K.

This module re-selects the stored profile for such a slot. It acts only when
the selection is *lost* (``cali_idx`` -1 or missing), never when the slot
holds a different real profile: that one was picked on purpose, in Bambu
Studio for example. A profile picked in Bambuddy's Configure Slot dialog is
saved as the spool's stored profile anyway, but a "Default" pick there is not
saved anywhere, so it is recorded through ``note_slot_configured`` and left
alone too.

Two callers: the status handler, on every push while the printer is idle, and
the print scheduler, just before it sends a job.
