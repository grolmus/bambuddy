"""Shared spool ``slicer_filament`` → ``(tray_info_idx, setting_id)`` resolver.

The internal-inventory and Spoolman-inventory routes both need to translate
a spool's stored slicer-preset reference (cloud preset ID / local preset ID /
GF-prefix Bambu filament ID / free-text material name) into the two MQTT
fields ``ams_filament_setting`` consumes: the printer-side ``tray_info_idx``
(filament_id) and the slicer-side ``setting_id``. The two routes were drifting
in lockstep before #1713 — internal mode resolved everything, Spoolman mode
silently dropped slicer_filament on the floor and only the generic-material
fallback fired. This module is the single chokepoint so the two flows can't
diverge again.

Resolver outcomes:

- Returns ``("", "", None)`` when ``slicer_filament`` is empty, unresolvable,
  or sanitised away as a slicer-rejected value (literal material name,
  PFUS / PFCN cloud setting_id). The caller is responsible for the
  generic-material fallback when this happens.
- Returns ``(tray_info_idx, setting_id, sub_brand_override)`` otherwise.
  The third element is non-empty when a cloud-detail lookup or a local-
  preset name provides a more specific brand label than the spool's own
  ``"<brand> <material> <subtype>"`` concatenation — the caller should
  prefer it over its computed default.

The resolver is async because the GFS / PFUS / PFCN branches need cloud
authentication and the local-preset branch reads ``LocalPreset`` from the
DB. Pass ``current_user=None`` to skip cloud auth (the on_ams_change
replay path uses this); cloud-prefix presets then fall back to a static
``normalize_slicer_filament`` parse, which is correct when the slot was
already configured by an earlier authenticated assign and the printer's
calibration table preserves the real filament_id.

    #      is free-text rather than a real preset ID. Product lines ("PLA+",

    #      by the slicer as tray_info_idx (the printer's calibration table
    #      indexes by filament_id, and a PFUS isn't one). This normally gets
    #      realigned to a P-prefix local id via the caller's printer_kp

    #      tray_info_idx — overwriting the correctly-configured slot from
    #      the original assign.

    #      "(Custom)" H2D variants, #1648) — same shape problem as PFUS.
